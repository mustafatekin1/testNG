What did we learn from previous class
- We created some reusable support classes under utilities package
-- Driver
-- ConfigReader

* Driver : We use this class from now on instead of TestBase
    - Our Driver class is "singleton" driver class
    - By also using configuration.properties and of course ConfigReader we can select browser.
    - So we add switch and create the relevant browser driver via Driver class.
   From now on==>  we just use "Driver.getDriver()," instead of "driver."
   - We use "static" in Driver class so that we can use the class across the whole framework globally.
   - We use "static" in ConfigReader class so that we can use the class across the whole framework globally also.

* configuration.properties : the file store most major test data
* ConfigReader : we read configuration.properties via this class
    - First we create configuration.properties under the top project
    - We create ConfigReader class to be able to read/load the configuration.properties
    - We can call many
        - url
        - browser
        - app_url
        - user_name
        - password
 ---- We make the test cases dynamic (not hard coded) with ConfigReader.
***target folder is created by compiler whenever we run tests.

* pom.xml -- (project object model) - the most important file in Maven project.
We add dependencies, properties, plugins and profiles
